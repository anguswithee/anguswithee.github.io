title: "About Me"
---
I am a sociology major with minors in public health and statistics. I am pursuing a career in social research and data analysis. I am interested in researching areas of social justice, such as senior issues, LGBTQ+ issues, and criminal justice reform. My hobbies include film, writing, hiking, and playing with my cat Miso Soup.
